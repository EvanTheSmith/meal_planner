# Meal Planner App

Using this app, a user can track the calories of all meals they consume in one given day. Presently this app is designed around a three-meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner) environment, but future updates could add the ability to include additional meals.

# Usage

Navigate to the "backend" internal directory and enter "rails s" into your terminal to launch the server. Once up and running, open Index.html in the "frontend" directory to use the app.

> This app requires the free Google font "Lora" to display as intended
